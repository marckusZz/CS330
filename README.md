# CS330
Work made during CS330
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software similarly to learning anything- i try to absorb as much information as possible about the topic, and then apply it as necessary. This didnt work for this project- I was behind and had to learn as i went, which went suprisingly well!
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working with 3d shapes and spaces. Before, I had next to no experience and wasnt even sure of how to start designing in 3d. The class has opened the door for me.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I mostly followed instructor instructions, but attempted to approach the project with coding very slowly, and constant testing. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
All coding should be done in batches, and this only solidified that school of thought for me. Before i was liable to code far too much before running any form of test. 
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs with referencing previous programs and attempting to use previous work from them. Other than that, i attempt to approach them from a slow, methodical standpoint. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I definitely developed a new appreciation for reading example code to understand how the process is executed, and applied it. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was fantastic for my development- each weekly project really assisted with creating the final program.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
This is a tougher question to answer- my general approach hasnt changed, but my determination and confidence have. This led to larger segments of code and being willing to dive deeper into errors to finish the particular things i wanted done. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is game design- computer science is critical in the field.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The course itself really reinforced how important time management is, and forced me to devote large chunks of time to study and practice. These are critical skills for my future education.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Again, the workload from falling behind was actually a bit of a blessing. Being forced to push myself was a key factor in finishing the course, and it gave me experience working in high pressure low time scenarios.
